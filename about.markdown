Hi there, thanks for checking out my site. I hope you're finding some ideas that make your wheels turn.

I'm a technically-skilled Humanist who believes that we are living in an incredible period of transition en route to the Singularity. Incredible, not like great or wonderful, but instead as its most literal definition. In-credible, not credible, unbelievable. The trends of human (and in a more meta-sense, the universe's) innovation, applauded today for getting us planes, cars, computers, and the internet has only just begun. It's easy to consider today the apex, since our only frame of reference is the past. But, a couple thousand years from now 'intelligent beings' will be looking back at us with a gaze more foreign than us toward the Romans.

In pursuit of shaping these trends, I've twice now found myself on the ground floor, or more fittingly - the launching pad, of extremely consequential threads of innovation. Once, as the Founder of an Augmented Reality company working to unlock the potential of the medium in a socially responsible way. And secondly, creating Machine Learning systems at a Biotech startup which will dramatically alter the Personalized/Regenerative Medicine space.

Paragraph on change outside of tech? - Pax Americana, - Technical changes are more than just new apps on our devices, but rather systemic alterations to the fabric of the reality we live within.

### Meta Purpose, etc

I hope to sway the future. Reiterating known ideas won't do that. Developing better proofs won't do that. I think the guiding light is - how can I convince people like [insert_intelligent_coworker] that Yuval Harari isn't pessimistic, but rather, is actually optimistic?? What is not being understood? These are smart people, after all. Maybe a distance from power behaving "optimally" i.e. aggressively? Maybe a new perspective of safety, risk-aversion, etc since the birth of police states and incredibly certain lives? Maybe a shift of ethics is needed to point out the gaping holes in startup, innovation, etc buzz? <- feel like this is covered quite well, actually.

I'd like to add novel, contrarian ideas into the world which will add value by aiding in better decision making.

Outline my fear, and develop my hope. 

My fear - A day will come when the light of the human race, our free spirit, goes out

Aiming to become an optimist - in the simplest form of the word - anticipating a positive future.
