Hi there, thanks for checking out my site. I hope you're finding some ideas that make your wheels turn.

I'm a technically-skilled Humanist who believes that we are living in an incredible period of transition en route to the "Singularity". Quotes here, because I'm referring to an event that's a little different from the [Technological Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity). But we'll get to that.

I say "incredible", not like great or wonderful, but instead as its most literal definition. In-credible, not credible, hard to believe. The trends of human (and in a more meta-sense, the universe's) innovation, applauded today for getting us computers, planes, cars, the internet, and electricity itself has only just begun. It's easy to consider today the apex, since our only frame of reference is the past. But, zoom out from an exponential curve and you'll see the section you had been focused on now looks eerily insignificant.

This is why, in a few hundred years the beings of the world will be looking back at us with a gaze more foreign than us to the Romans. Hard to believe, right? Consider this though. That statement would've been true for us even if we lived in the 16 and 1700s - a world without any of those inventions mentioned above. Assuming an exponential, the Roman-familiarity-litmus-test is even more true for us today.

In pursuit of shaping these ever-growing waves, I've twice now found myself on the ground floor, or more fittingly - the launching pad, of extremely consequential threads of innovation. Once, as the [Founder](https://powaqqatsi.github.io/thoughts/2021/06/01/The-End-Of-Marae.html) of an Augmented Reality company aiming to shatter the ceiling of what's fundamentally possible in the medium (and in turn inject my values into it). And currently, as an engineer building Machine Learning systems for a Biotech startup which will dramatically alter the Personalized/Regenerative Medicine space.

Technical change is more than just new apps on our devices, but rather systemic alterations to the fabric of reality we live within. Notably, it has tended to bring us closer. Accents, cultures, and opinions seem to flatten and merge, as viral memes now have the channels to tear across our ecosystem of ideas. When does this flattening stop? Who has the power to spread these memes, or distort the ecosystem our ideas live within?

I worry that these trends won't stop, and that the diversity of consciousness we have today will eventually merge into one. The "Singularity". Either we're strapped into [BMIs](https://youtu.be/2rXrGH52aoM) without any real individual willpower, or [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) has made humanity redundant (precursor to being eliminated).

I'm convinced a day will come when the light of the human race, our free spirit, goes out.

Bummer, right? Well I hope I'm wrong.

That's actually why I've started this thing. To outline my fear and discover my hope. Fleshing out these ideas with you, we'll find gaps in my reasoning. A crucial enough gap, and we've got Jason thinking there's no extinction event on the distant horizon. :)

And if not, we'll have a little more urgency to figure out the best path forward.
